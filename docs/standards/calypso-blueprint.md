# Calypso Blueprint for Web Applications

## 0. Development Prerequisites

**Environment & Setup**

* Continuous development, testing, and operation must occur natively on a bare-metal Linux host in the cloud (e.g., DigitalOcean). 
* **Local Development Exception:** Users *are allowed* to perform the initial "Scaffold" phase (repository setup, documentation, initial source code) on their local development machines (e.g., Mac or Windows). However, if you (the AI agent) detect that the active environment is a local Mac or Windows machine, you must interject and occasionally "nag" the user, reminding them that to develop correctly and continuously they must move to a remote Linux host.
* Development tasks must be executed by an AI agent (e.g., Claude, Gemini, Codex, or whichever agent is used) running inside a `tmux` session on the remote host to ensure persistence.
* The development host also serves as the live demo/preview server.
* Port `31415` (the designated Calypso dev port) must be exposed on the host to access the live development preview.

**Linux Host Dependencies**
Before bootstrapping a Calypso project, the bare-metal Linux host must have the following system dependencies installed:
1. `git`: Version control.
2. `gh` (GitHub CLI): Must be installed and fully authenticated via HTTPS (`gh auth login -p https -w`)
3. `tmux`: Required to persist the agent's session remotely.
4. `bun`: The core JavaScript runtime.
5. **The AI Agent CLI:** The specific CLI tool for the chosen agent (e.g., Claude Code, Cursor server, Gemini CLI).
6. **Playwright OS Dependencies:** Operating system libraries required to run headless Chromium for browser testing (typically installed via `bunx playwright install-deps`).

## 0. Agent Standards
* Different agent vendors (Claude, Codex, Gemini) have different ways of producing instructions for agents. These are currently defined as .md txt files. 
You should have a `docs/standards/` folder in the project root which includes the .md files with the various standards that agents should follow.

## Agent Standards Folder

When bootstrapping a new project, create a `.docs/standards/` directory in the project root containing template standards:

```
.calypso/
├── standards/
│   ├── documentation-standard.md
│   ├── development-standards.md
│   ├── git-standards.md
│   └── ...
```

These standards are the **source of truth** for this project. Users may customize them in `.calypso/standards/` to fit their specific requirements.

### Agent Session Requirement

**At the start of every session**, the agent MUST read all files in `.docs/standards/` to understand the current project conventions. This applies regardless of which AI vendor or model is being used. Failure to do so may result in work that violates project standards.


## 1. Architecture

**Stack**

* Language: TypeScript only; no other languages permitted.
* Runtime: Bun (server and build tasks).
* UI: React (latest stable).
* Styling: Tailwind CSS (vanilla CSS, no processors).
* State Management: React hooks or minimal context; no heavy state libraries.
* Testing: Vitest (unit), Playwright (browser/E2E).

**Build & Separation**

* Browser code: `/apps/web` → React + Tailwind, browser-only bundle.
* Server code: `/apps/server` → Bun + Node ESM.
* Packages: `/packages/ui`, `/packages/core`, `/packages/services`, `/packages/integrations`.
* Strict separation of browser vs server runtime code.
* CI/CD pipelines enforce separate builds.

**Data & Integration Guidelines**

* Prefer REST APIs for all business integrations.
* Define universal application types in TypeScript for all API inputs/outputs.
* Avoid GraphQL, WebSockets, or Protobufs unless system requires massive users or low-latency real-time.
* Keep types minimal and explicit to prevent casting, mutation, or hidden conversions.
* AI agents may generate type-safe interfaces automatically from API definitions.
* All API contracts are versioned and type-checked against production responses.

**Core Services**

* Ingestion / integration services (REST API clients).
* Core business logic / domain services.
* UI modules, editors, or workspaces.
* Export / external integration modules.
* Authentication and authorization modules.

## 2. Dependency Policy

**Principle:** Hyper minimalism, which prevents software bloat and ensures long-term maintainability. Dependencies are a trade-off. We do not clone everything, but use discretion to determine when to buy vs DIY. Conciseness and removing boilerplate is important for humans, but not for AI agents; they can focus on resilient code with fewer assumptions and constraints, and tree shake just the needed functions from what would previously been a dependency supply chain.

**Threshold for Adding a Dependency**

1. Critical functionality not feasible internally within reasonable effort.
2. Mature, minimal footprint, well-maintained package.

**Strategy**

* Use discretion when considering external packages.
* **Buy (Import) Example:** Complex external integrations (e.g., Stripe SDK), highly specialized libraries with strict compliance requirements, or massive well-tested utility libraries where DIY is error-prone.
* **DIY (Clone/Re-implement) Example:** Simple utility functions (e.g. basic date formatting instead of `date-fns`), small UI components, or trivial helpers where an AI agent can cleanly generate a fully tested, tree-shaken internal version without bloating context. 
* Lock versions and review dependency trees regularly.
* Document all dependencies in `docs/dependencies.md`, including risk/benefit justification.
* Avoid cascading dependencies.

## 3. Process
0. **Quickstart / Scaffold:** 
   * **Version Control:** Initialize git (`git init`), authenticate GitHub CLI using HTTPS (`gh auth login -p https -w`), and create the remote repository (`gh repo create`).
   * **CI Setup:** Immediately create the CI jobs (e.g., GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/`) so they run from day one.
   * **TDD Environment:** You should not develop by opening a browser on localhost. You should always use a headless instance, execute headless browser tests (e.g., Playwright), and strictly do Test-Driven Development (TDD). You should stub all the testsuites before building any features: server unit, integration, browser unit, browser component, browser e2e.

1. **Collect Specifications:** The AI agent must generate an `.md` document containing comprehensive onboarding interview questions for the Product Owner to extract requirements. An explicit template prompt is provided to instruct the agent on generating these questions. The agent then writes a canonical Product Requirements Doc to `docs/prd.md` based on the answers. The Product Owner/Manager will own and update this document moving forward.
2. **Prototype:** mock data, minimal UI, basic flows, no persistence.
3. **Demoware:** partial integrations, realistic UI, stable demo workflows.
4. **Alpha:** full persistence, authentication, core business logic.
5. **Beta:** external integrations, performance, reliability, metrics.
6. **V1:** production-ready stability, observability, backups.

## 4. Testing Philosophy

**Core Principles**

* **Never mock** anything: no APIs, databases, DOM, or external services.
* **Always test on the environment the code will run in:** Linux for server and browser testing; no Mac/Windows shortcuts.
* Browser code tested only in headless Chromium (Vitest + Playwright).
* API tests must use **recorded "golden" fixtures of real production requests/responses**. To enable this without a human, the AI must explicitly develop a test tool which generates these "golden" fixtures by executing real network requests against external services. It must not mock, estimate, or hallucinate these fixtures.
* CI/CD enforces passing tests in production-like environments.

**Client-Side Test Categories**

1. **Unit Tests:**

   * Pure logic or modules that do **not require an API server**.
   * Validate algorithms, transformations, utility functions.

2. **API Integration Tests:**

   * Validate REST API calls against production-recorded fixtures.
   * Ensure TypeScript types match actual production schemas.

3. **React Component Tests:**

   * Test individual React components **in a headless browser**.
   * Validate rendering, props handling, state updates, styling, and interactions in isolation.

4. **Full-Page User Story Tests:**

   * Click-through flows covering navigation, forms, and workflows.
   * Ensures all components and integrations work together end-to-end.

**Implementation Notes**

* Unit tests are fast and deterministic; run locally in CI.
* Component and full-page tests **always run in headless Chromium**.
* API integration tests intercept HTTPS calls using recorded fixtures; never invent responses.
* Tests **validate real runtime behavior**, not mocks or simulated environments.


---

## 5. CI/CD Environment

**Platform**

* GitHub as VCS and CI/CD host.
* GitHub Actions as workflow engine.

**Workflow Design Principles**

* **One workflow per test suite**:

  * Unit
  * API Integration
  * React Component
  * Full-Page User Story
* Avoid multiple jobs in a single workflow — granularity allows precise failure diagnosis.
* Each workflow file contains all setup and teardown needed for that suite.

**Code Quality Checks**

* Linting (e.g., ESLint) and formatting (e.g., Prettier) are enforced **before tests run**.
* Tests are gated: failing lint/format or failed test suite **blocks merge**.

**Test Execution**

* Each workflow runs on Linux runners.
* Browser tests use headless Chromium via Playwright + Vitest. (Do not use browser runner/reporters, just command line tests)
* API integration tests use **recorded HTTPS fixtures**.
* CI mirrors **exact production environment**: no mocks, no Mac/Windows shortcuts.
* AI agents scaffold GitHub Actions YAML automatically for each test suite.

**Deployment Integration**

* Milestone-based deployment: Alpha → Beta → V1.
* Each deployment workflow uses CI validation: only pass-tested code is deployed.
* Logging, monitoring, backups enforced during Beta stage.

**Enforcement Rules for AI Agents**

* Always generate a separate `.github/workflows/*.yml` file per test suite.
* Include linting/formatting steps in each workflow.
* Do not merge or deploy code without CI passing all workflows.

## 6. Deployment

**Target Environment**

* Bare metal deployment targeting Linux natively. Avoid Docker.
* Applications are strictly kept alive natively using `systemd`.
* Environment variables are specified using `.env` files.
* Test environment variables (including `FIXTURES`) are safely pushed to the repository in `.env.test` for CI execution.
* Bun serves server APIs and static assets.
* Reverse proxy optional; CDN optional.
* Deployment must remain simple; avoid unnecessary complexity.

**CI/CD**

* Separate build pipelines for browser and server.
* Deploy per milestone (Alpha/Beta/V1).
* Logging, monitoring, backups enforced at Beta stage.
* Observability of errors, external integrations, and user actions.

**Constraints**

* Maintain single-stack coherence (TypeScript + Bun + React + Tailwind).
* Follow the dependency discretion policy (Buy vs DIY).
* No polyglot microservices unless explicitly required.
* No direct database calls from browser code.

---

## 7. Logging & Telemetry

**SPAN Logging, Tracing, and Summarization**

* **Browser-to-Server Handoff:** Browser errors (React error boundaries, unhandled rejections, DOM crashes) must be explicitly caught and POSTed back to the Bun server's `/api/logs` endpoint.
* **Distributed Traces:** Every request/interaction must generate a unique `traceId`. This trace must seamlessly follow the user from the browser click down to the database query, allowing perfect chronological reconstruction of any workflow.
* **LLM-friendly `uniques.log`:** In addition to a standard chronological stdout/file log, the server must maintain a `uniques.log` file.
  * This file acts as a Set of errors, deduplicating repetitive alerts.
  * An AI agent inspecting the system should only need to read `uniques.log` to see the *categories* of errors currently afflicting the system, without wasting its token context window scrolling through thousands of identical "Timeout" errors.
* **Retention Policy:** Logs should be rotated (e.g., daily) and kept for a maximum of 14 days on the bare-metal server to prevent disk exhaustion, unless explicitly offloaded to a cold storage solution like S3.

## 8. Database & Authentication

**Database Standards**
* **Engine:**  Up until V0, for demos and development, use SQLite (natively via `bun:sqlite`) for single-node vertical scaling and hyper minimalism. This is of course not a long-term strategy, and the agent should configure a durable redundant service like locally deployed PostgreSQL or a cloud-hosted solution like Supabase.
* **Accessing Data:** There is no need for ORMs if agents are building the database queries directly, (like Prisma or TypeORM) that abstract away SQL performance and add massive generated footprint, but this only matters for human developers. AI agents should generate the database queries strings directly. 

**Authentication Standards**
* **Self-Hosted First:** Avoid external SaaS authentication providers (e.g., Auth0, Clerk) unless explicitly mandated by the Product Owner. These add unnecessary latency, vendor lock-in, and cost for features an AI agent can build natively in seconds.
* **Mechanism:** Use simple, self-hosted JWTs stored in secure HTTP-only cookies.
* **Implementation:** Agents must generate inhouse minimalist JWT auth middlewares directly within the Bun server using standard web crypto architectures, keeping the auth logic completely owned by the internal repository.
