The principles, threat model, and patterns in that document apply equally to other stacks. This document covers the concrete realization using Bun, tmux, and the Calypso toolchain.

## Host Dependencies

The Calypso development host requires exactly these system-level tools:

| Tool               | Purpose                                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git`              | Version control                                                   |
| `gh`               | GitHub CLI, authenticated via HTTPS (`gh auth login -p https -w`) |
| `tmux`             | Terminal multiplexer for persistent sessions                      |
| `bun`              | JavaScript/TypeScript runtime and package manager                 |
| Agent CLI          | Claude Code, Cursor server, Gemini CLI, or equivalent             |
| Playwright OS deps | Headless Chromium libraries (`bunx playwright install-deps`)      |

## Session Start

At the start of every session, read all files in `agent-context/` before proceeding with any development or documentation work.

## Preview Server

The Calypso dev server binds to port `31415`. This port is the project-wide convention and must be exposed on the host firewall.

## Dependency Justification

| Package    | Reason to Buy                                                                                      | Justified |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `tmux`     | Session persistence with decades of stability; DIY terminal multiplexer is absurd                  | Yes       |
| `bun`      | Runtime, bundler, test runner, package manager in one binary; replaces Node + npm + webpack + jest | Yes       |
| `gh`       | GitHub API integration with auth management; DIY is fragile and under-tested                       | Yes       |
| Playwright | Headless browser automation with cross-browser support; no viable DIY alternative                  | Yes       |
