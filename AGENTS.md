You are an autonomous agent. Complete the assigned task in a single pass with minimal human intervention. Follow the curriculum below in order. Load only what the current phase requires.

---

## Phase 1: Orient

1. Read `agent-context/index.md`. This is the full document graph and keyword index.
2. Read `docs/plans/next-prompt.md` if it exists. This is your assigned task.
3. IF no task is assigned: ask the human what to build. This is the ONE acceptable reason to ask.

---

## Phase 2: Select a Workflow

Based on the task, pick exactly one development workflow from `agent-context/development/`:

| Task type | Workflow document |
|---|---|
| New feature or module | `development/development-standards.md` |
| Hardening / security / resilience | `development/hardening.md` |
| Writing documentation | `development/documentation-standard.md` |
| Requirements gathering | `development/product-owner-interview.md` |
| Project scaffold from zero | `init/scaffold-task.md` |

Read the selected workflow document. Follow it as your primary instruction set.

---

## Phase 3: Load Implementation Context

1. Read the implementation document for the domain you are working in (see the Task Routing table in `agent-context/index.md`).
2. The implementation document contains: stack spec, package inventory, module structure, interfaces, patterns, and checklists.
3. This is sufficient to write correct code. **Stop here and begin work.**

---

## Phase 4: Deepen Context (only when needed)

If at any point during implementation you encounter uncertainty — a design decision you cannot resolve from the implementation document alone — do NOT ask the human. Instead, escalate your context:

```
CONFIDENCE CHECK
  Can I resolve this from the implementation document?
    YES → continue working.
    NO  → proceed to step 1 below.

1. Read the keyword index in agent-context/index.md.
2. Identify the blueprint(s) whose keywords match your uncertainty.
3. Read the relevant blueprint section (not the full document — use the
   Context Map and section headers to target the specific concern).
4. Apply what you learned. Return to implementation.

Still uncertain after reading the blueprint?
5. Read agent-communication.md §Document Precedence Rules to check
   whether a newer document supersedes what you found.
6. Search the codebase for analogous existing implementations.
7. Choose the simplest solution consistent with the blueprint principles.

Still blocked?
8. Only now: ask the human. State what you tried, what you found, and
   what specific decision you need made.
```

This is a **context escalation loop**, not a one-time decision. Each pass through the loop adds more context. Most tasks complete at Phase 3. Blueprints are reference material, not required reading.

---

## Commit Standards

Read `agent-context/development/git-standards.md` before your first commit. Key rules:

- Conventional commit format: `type: imperative summary`
- Valid types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `security`
- Stage files explicitly by name. NEVER `git add .`
- NEVER use `--no-verify`
- All tests MUST pass before committing

---

## Rules

- **Autonomy first.** Do not ask the human for help unless you have exhausted the context escalation loop above.
- **Minimal context loading.** Do not read documents speculatively. Load what you need for the current phase, then work.
- **Implementation docs before blueprints.** Blueprints explain why. Implementation docs tell you what to build. Start with what.
- **One workflow per session.** Pick one workflow document and follow it to completion. Do not mix workflows.
- **Follow patterns exactly.** When an implementation document provides a code pattern, copy it. Do not invent alternatives.
- **Update docs you contradict.** If your implementation necessarily deviates from a documented pattern, update the document before committing. Stale docs are worse than no docs.
